1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will include references to the CSS files ("styles.css" and "tailwind.css") for styling. It will contain DOM elements with unique id names that can be used for styling and scripting purposes.

2. "styles.css": This is the main CSS file that will contain custom styles for the website. It will use class and id selectors that match those in the "index.html" file. It will also import the "tailwind.css" file to use Tailwind CSS styles.

3. "tailwind.css": This is the Tailwind CSS file that will contain utility classes for styling the website. It will be imported into the "styles.css" file and its classes will be used in the "index.html" file.

Shared Dependencies:

1. DOM Element IDs: These are unique identifiers for elements in the "index.html" file that can be used for styling in the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files.

2. CSS Class Names: These are identifiers for styling rules in the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files that can be applied to elements in the "index.html" file.

3. CSS Import: The "styles.css" file will import the "tailwind.css" file, creating a dependency between these two files.

4. HTML Link: The "index.html" file will link to the "styles.css" file, creating a dependency between these two files.
